%---------------------------------------------------------
With eight years of professional experience, I've had the opportunity to work with multiple types of companies: software editor, service company, consulting company \& financial sector company. Working with both technical \& functional teams, I've learnt how to match needs from a team with expectations of the other one.
Originally from a course in development, it is with managing infrastructure that I've been able to flourish with a strong interest in infrastructure design \& automation using open source technology.
I'm now evolving on automating complex developer centric platforms (PaaS).
